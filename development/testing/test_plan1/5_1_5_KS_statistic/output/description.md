<h2>5.1.5 KS statistic</h2>
The KS statistic is used to measure the discriminatory power of the PD model. It is defined as the maximum difference between the cumulative percentage of good samples (i.e., non-defaulters) and the cumulative percentage of bad samples (i.e., defaulters). A higher KS value implies a good fit of the model.

The test returns a KS value.
