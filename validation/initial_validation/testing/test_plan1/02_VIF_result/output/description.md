<h2>5.2.2 Variance Inflation Factor</h2>
This test is to assess the multicollinearity among the risk drivers. The variance inflation factor (VIF) quantifies the severity of multicollinearity in an regression analysis caused by correlation between multiple ‘independent variables’ in a  model (i.e., the risk drivers). It is a measure of how much the variance of an estimated regression coefficient is inflated because of multicollinearity in the model. High levels of multicollinearity results in unstable parameter estimates and renders the model statistically invalid.

The test returns VIF value for each variable listed in the table below.
